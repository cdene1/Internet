        <br><br><br>

        <b>The internet:</b> <p>The Internet is a vast network of interconnected devices, individuals, and resources operating simultaneously across borders. Basically, the Internet is a network of roads upon which existing nodes and access points travel to communicate with each other. It is the global domain existing beneath the cables, laid miles deep in our oceans and floating satellites above. The internet is a massive decentralized network through which people can communicate with other people thousands of miles away, and access previously secured data that is now available. The internet employs various control and control systems elements to respond to requests and fulfill responses. It is how people communicate, watch streams, and it is how people work and exist. While one would think of something as grand as the internet to be a conceptualized false idea without actual physical display, there is a reliance on the internet ingrained in real-world application, knowledge, and experience. The Internet is a decentralized control system; no one person or entity controls it but relies upon something that connects it all and provides people with a means of connection.</p>
